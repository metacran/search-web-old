      <h1>About the <a href="index.html">CRAN <i class="icon-rlogo"></i>
	package search</a></h1>

      <h3>What?</h3>
      <p>This is a service that searches the descriptions of all active
      CRAN <i class="icon-rlogo"></i> packages.</p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>Searching is just easier than organizing.</p>

      <p>How would you find all packages that are related
	to <em>networks?</em>. You can try searching manually on the CRAN
	web pages, or use CRAN task views, and these sometimes work, but
	often they don't. You cannot easily search in the package
	descriptions, and task views are not updated as frequently as the
	packages themselves. Taks views are also opinionated, and not all
	packages are (or even can be!) classified into the existing
	categories.</p>

      <p>The existing <i class="icon-rlogo"></i> search services do a good
	job in many cases, when you need to find a specific function, or
	need to know how to perform a simple task in <i
	class="icon-rlogo"></i>. They are not the best at finding <i
	class="icon-rlogo"></i> packages related to a given topic.</p>

      <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>We check CRAN frequently for changes, and update
	<a href="https://github.com/metacran/crandb">our database</a>
	if a new package was admitted to CRAN, a package was updated, or
	archived. The database is automatically indexed by an
	Elastissearch server.</p>

      <h3>Command line version</h3>
      <p>You can also use this service from within R, using the
	<a href="https://github.com/metacran/seer">seer package</a>.</p>

      <h3>Contributions</h3>
      <p>Your contribution is welcome! Please open an issue in
	our <a href="https://github.com/metacran/search/issues">issue
	  tracker</a> to tell us what you think, or if you found a bug.
